# Hedvig Web CLI
Used to manage node projects at scale. Handles webpack build and development cycles + config file syncs. Depends on [@hedviginsurance/web-survival-kit](https://github.com/HedvigInsurance/web-survival-kit) for all config stuff, this is merely the wrapper/cli tool.

## Usage
This project is still under heavy development, so to avoid getting stale documentation please see the instructions provided when running `yarn hedvig`, or `./cli`if youre in *this* project.
